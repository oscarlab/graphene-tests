# Graphene Applications

This repository contains application samples for
[Graphene Library OS](https://github.com/oscarlab/graphene).
For how to build and run the Graphene Library OS,
please see the README in the Graphene repository.

For the instructions to build and run each application under
Graphene, please see the README in each subdirectory.

## How to Contribute?

If you are interested in submitting an application sample for Graphene,
please submit a pull request to this GitHub repository.

Please put your application sample in a subdirectory with a
comprehensive name. Ideally, the subdirectory name should be the same
as your application. In addition, your application sample should
have the following elements:

- `README.md`:
  Please document the tested environment and the instruction for
  building and running the application. If your application sample
  has any known issue or requirement, please also specify in the
  documentation.

- `Makefile`:
  Users should be able to build your application sample by running
  the `make` command. If your application needs extra building steps,
  please document them in the `README.md`. In addition. we ask you
  to provide sufficient comments in the `Makefile` to help users
  understand the building process.

- Manifest(s):
  Please provide all the manifests needed for running your application
  sample. Do not hard-code any user-specific path or personal info
  in the manifests. The ideal way is to create manifest templates that
  contains variables to be replaced with runtime options in `Makefile`.
  See other subdirectories for examples of the manifest templates.
  We also ask you to provide sufficient comments in all the manifests
  to help users understand the environment.

- Sample inputs and test suites:
  If you have any inputs and test suites for testing the application,
  please provide them in the same subdirectory, too.

Please do not include any tarball of source code or binaries in the
application samples. If an application requires downloading the source
code or binaries, please provide the instruction in the `README.md`.
