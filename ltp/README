LTP FOR GRAPHENE
================

Just run `make regression`.

Test results are reported as an XML file, ltp.xml, which is for consumption in
Jenkins. There is also rudimentary logging.

To run a single testcase, execute the following commands:
    cd <LTP_REPO>/opt/ltp/testcases/bin/
    <GRAPHENE_DIR>/Runtime/pal_loader <TEST_BINARY>

In this way, one can debug one particular syscall testcase.

`ltp.conf`
----------

This is a file in `.ini` format (https://docs.python.org/library/configparser).
Lines starting with `#` and `;` are comments. Section names are names of the
binaries. There is one special section, `[DEFAULT]`, which holds defaults for
all binaries and some global options.

Global options:
- `jobs`: run that many tests in parallel (default is 1 under SGX and number of
  CPUs otherwise); **WARNING:** Because EPC has limited size, test suite may
  become unstable if more than one test is running concurrently under SGX
- `junit-classname`: classname to be shown in JUnit-XML report (`LTP`)
- `loader`: path to `pal_loader` (default: `./pal_loader`)
- `ltproot`: path to LTP (default: `./opt/ltp`)

Per-binary options:
- `skip`: if true-ish, do not attempt to run the binary (default: false).
- `timeout` in seconds (default: `30`)

Another config file path can be specified using `--config` argument to
`./runltp_xml.py`. Options can be overridden as parameters to `-o` argument.
See `--help`.


Flaky tests
-----------

These should be debugged, or revisited after memory debugging PRs are merged

waitpid03,1 and 2 - fails about 20% of the time
preadv01 - fails intermittently in CI - perhaps an unrelated bug?
preadv01,2
preadv01,3
preadv01,4

waitpid02 - Gets a segfault in debug build fairly often
waitpid02,1
waitpid02,2
waitpid02,3

clock_nanosleep01,11 - Pretty prone to hanging, don't think it is a timeout

sendfile05,1 - pretty prone to a segfault, perhaps an unrelated issue
Internal memory fault at 0x8 (IP = +0x34f1a, VMID = 3902099696, TID = 1)

Prone to hanging - I think a memory corruption issue that may have a pending fix

recvfrom01,2

# glibc issue:
# Once glibc version is upgraded, this can be moved to PASSED
#
# old(2.19) glibc includes a work around for sleep(3)
# which make kill12 unstable due to race condition.
# The following glibc changeset removed such work around.
#   commit 8c873bf0190740ac1102e13ff7aeb6c08048abfd
#   Remove signal handling for nanosleep (bug 16364)
